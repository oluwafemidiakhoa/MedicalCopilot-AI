# üéâ How to View Your MedicalCopilot AI App

## ‚úÖ The API is Now Running!

Your advanced multi-agent medical AI system is live at:
- **API Base URL**: http://localhost:8001
- **Port**: 8001 (to avoid conflict with Lemonade Server on 8000)

---

## üåê Three Ways to View the App

### Option 1: Test UI (Quick & Easy) ‚≠ê RECOMMENDED

**Open the test interface:**
1. Navigate to your project folder: `C:\Users\adminidiakhoa\cagent\`
2. **Double-click** on `test-ui.html`
3. It will open in your default browser

**Or paste this in your browser:**
```
file:///C:/Users/adminidiakhoa/cagent/test-ui.html
```

This gives you:
- ‚úÖ Beautiful UI to input clinical data
- ‚úÖ Real-time visualization of all 16 agents working
- ‚úÖ Live WebSocket updates as agents execute
- ‚úÖ Final clinical report with JSON output
- ‚úÖ Quick links to API documentation

### Option 2: API Documentation UI (Interactive)

**Open in your browser:**
```
http://localhost:8001/docs
```

This is the **Swagger UI** - fully interactive API documentation where you can:
- See all 16 API endpoints
- Try them out directly in the browser
- View request/response schemas
- Test the `/analyze` endpoint with sample data

### Option 3: Direct API Calls (For Developers)

**Test the API using curl or Postman:**

```bash
# Check health
curl http://localhost:8001/

# List all 16 agents
curl http://localhost:8001/agents

# Run an analysis
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/analyze \
  -F 'intake={"chief_complaint":"Chest pain with exertion","hpi":"45 year old with cardiovascular risk factors","pmh":"Hypertension, hyperlipidemia","medications":"Lisinopril, atorvastatin","allergies":"NKDA"}'
```

---

## üéØ Quick Demo Steps

### Using the Test UI (test-ui.html)

1. **Open** `test-ui.html` in your browser
2. **Fill in the form:**
   - Chief Complaint: `Chest pain with exertion for 3 days`
   - HPI: `45 year old male, symptoms worsen with activity, relieved by rest`
   - PMH: `Hypertension, hyperlipidemia`
   - Medications: `Lisinopril 10mg daily, Atorvastatin 40mg daily`
   - Allergies: `NKDA (No Known Drug Allergies)`

3. **Click** "üöÄ Run Multi-Agent Analysis"

4. **Watch in real-time** as 16 specialized medical AI agents execute:
   - clinical_coordinator (orchestrating)
   - intake_specialist (structuring data)
   - symptom_analyzer (analyzing patterns)
   - differential_diagnosis_agent (generating diagnoses)
   - medical_literature_agent (searching evidence)
   - drug_interaction_checker (checking safety)
   - clinical_guidelines_agent (applying guidelines)
   - evidence_synthesizer (integrating findings)
   - clinical_reasoning_agent (reasoning)
   - risk_stratification_agent (assessing risk)
   - medical_fact_checker (validating)
   - safety_guardian (ensuring safety)
   - ethics_reviewer (checking ethics)
   - medical_writer (generating report)

5. **View the final report** with:
   - Urgency level
   - Differential diagnoses (with ICD-11 codes)
   - Risk scores
   - Evidence-based recommendations
   - Red flag warnings
   - Patient education

## üìä What You're Seeing

### The Magic of Multi-Agent AI

When you run an analysis, you'll see **16 specialized medical AI agents** working together:

1. **Real-time execution**: Watch each agent's status change from "running" to "completed"
2. **Confidence scores**: See how confident each agent is (85-99%)
3. **Phase tracking**: Understand what stage the analysis is in
4. **Live updates**: WebSocket connection streams updates as they happen

### The Clinical Report

The final output includes:
- **Urgency Classification**: emergent/urgent/semi-urgent/non-urgent
- **Differential Diagnosis**: Ranked list with probabilities
- **Risk Stratification**: Clinical risk scores (HEART, CURB-65, etc.)
- **Recommendations**:
  - Diagnostic workup
  - Treatment considerations
  - Monitoring parameters
  - Specialist referrals
- **Evidence Base**: Citations from medical literature
- **Patient Education**: Plain-language guidance

netstat -ano | findstr :8001

# Kill it (replace PID with actual number)
taskkill /PID <PID> /F
```

### Restart the Server
```bash
cd C:\Users\adminidiakhoa\cagent
python api_server.py
```

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### Can't access the UI?
- Make sure you opened `test-ui.html` in a browser (double-click it)
- Check the file path is correct

### WebSocket not connecting?
- Verify the API is running: `curl http://localhost:8001/`
- Check browser console for errors (F12)

### Port 8001 already in use?
- Change the port in `api_server.py` (line 579)
- Update the URL in `test-ui.html` (line 267)
