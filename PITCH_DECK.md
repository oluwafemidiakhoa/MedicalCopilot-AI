# MedicalCopilot AI - Pitch Deck

---

## 🏥 The Problem

**Current medical AI systems have critical limitations:**

❌ **Black Box Decision-Making** - Physicians can't see how AI reaches conclusions
❌ **Single-Model Limitations** - One AI trying to do everything → inconsistent quality
❌ **Lack of Transparency** - No confidence scores, no reasoning visibility
❌ **Insufficient Validation** - No built-in fact-checking or safety review
❌ **Poor Clinical Integration** - Not designed for real clinical workflows

**Result:** Physicians don't trust AI systems. Adoption remains low.
